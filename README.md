# ATM-system
Banks are not in every corner of the block. It can be inconvenient for some people to drive to the bank to withdraw or deposit money. Other times people may not be caring enough cash to purchase goods. ATMs are becoming popular as they allow people to withdraw and deposit money. I have programed and ATM-system to provide quick service to people who have a bank account. This program is for banks. 
	In my program, I allow the user to either log into their account or create an account. These accounts are connected to their bank accounts, by being provided one’s bank account and pin number. Sometimes people forget to carry their debit cards; my program does not require people to use their debit cards to log in. If one has never made an account to use the ATM, they can quickly link their bank account to the system and continue to either deposit or withdraw money. 
	Many ATMs only withdraw cash from one’s account. In my program, people are allowed to withdraw coins. Also, people can withdraw any amount of money from their account, as long as they have the funds for it. All the user’s balance will be updated when they withdraw/deposit money. People can continuously withdraw/deposit money until the choose to exit the program. Perfect for those who want to cash in a check and then withdraw some of it.
